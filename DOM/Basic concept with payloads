What is taint flow?
To either exploit or mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is important to first familiarize yourself with the basics of taint flow between sources and sinks. 
1.Source:A source is a JavaScript property that accepts data that is potentially attacker-controlled. An example of a source is the location.search property because it reads input from the query string, which is relatively simple for an attacker to control. Ultimately, any property that can be controlled by the attacker is a potential source. This includes the referring URL (exposed by the document.referrer string), the user's cookies (exposed by the document.cookie string), and web messages. 
#### common sources ########
document.URL
document.documentURI
document.URLUnencoded
document.baseURI
location
document.cookie
document.referrer
window.name
history.pushState
history.replaceState
localStorage
sessionStorage
IndexedDB (mozIndexedDB, webkitIndexedDB, msIndexedDB)
Database


2.Sink :A sink is a potentially dangerous JavaScript function or DOM object that can cause undesirable effects if attacker-controlled data is passed to it. For example, the eval() function is a sink because it processes the argument that is passed to it as JavaScript. An example of an HTML sink is document.body.innerHTML because it potentially allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and execute arbitrary JavaScript.

prevent DOM-based taint-flow vulnerabilities
1.the most effective way to avoid DOM-based vulnerabilities is to avoid allowing data from any untrusted source to dynamically alter the value that is transmitted to any sink.
2.If the desired functionality of the application means that this behavior is unavoidable, then defenses must be implemented within the client-side code. In many cases, the relevant data can be validated on a whitelist basis, only allowing content that is known to be safe.
